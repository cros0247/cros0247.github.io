        </header>
        <p>I am 21 years old and this is the second time I've been to college. At the peak of Covid I initially attempted an architecture program at Humber College, but the college program didn't live up to my standards for what I wanted/expected. In the middle of my second year I made the decision to switch career paths since my time at Humber killed my motivation to continue with architecture.</p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed creating/building/designing things, which initially led me to pursue a career in architecture. However, with the world's technological advancements and my own interest in UI/UX design, I<sup>'</sup>ve noticed the growing importance of this field. Personally, I've frequently encountered websites with subpar interfaces, making me think, 'I could improve this.' This realization prompted me to test my skills, and now I'm enthusiastic and prepared to learn more about <abbr title="User Interface / User Experience design" UIUX design.>UIUX design. </abbr></p>
